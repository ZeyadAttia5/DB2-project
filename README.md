# Small Database Engine with B+ Tree Index Support

This project implements a small database engine with support for a B+ tree index. It provides functionalities for creating tables, inserting and updating tuples, deleting tuples, searching in tables linearly, creating a B+ tree index upon demand, and using the created indices where appropriate. Please note that this is a simplified database engine and does not support foreign keys, referential integrity constraints, or joins.
